# Changelog

## v0.2.3
- Make the d20 to float on all screen sizes.
- Added styles for the d20 button active state for feedback.
- Removed ugly outline from d20 focus. Bad for accessibililty but let's fix that somehow.

## v0.2.2
- Set all filters off by default to reduce needed clicks.
- The filter change caused awfully bright white to peek below footer so added a background color for the page.
- Removed some semicolons to unify the code.
